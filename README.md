<h1>
  A basic Hummingbird Unity game to train and apply machine learning agents
</h1>
In this project, we have built an agent that control hummingbird to collect nectar. This agent has trained with ppo algorithm, have 2 layer and 256 hidden units in neural network, and trained in 10 hours. Final result is hb_256_final.onnx file in ![CS106.O21/Assets/Hummingbird/nnmodels](CS106.O21/Assets/Hummingbird/nnmodels) (<a>)
